\section{RFID Attack Analysis}

\subsection{Question 1: What are the main vulnerabilities in RFID systems?}

\textbf{Answer:}

RFID systems face multi-layered security vulnerabilities that primarily stem from inherent limitations in technical design and insufficient security considerations during implementation.

At the communication protocol level, many RFID systems employ plaintext transmission methods, where data exchange between tags and readers lacks encryption protection, allowing attackers to easily intercept and analyze transmitted information. The absence or weakness of authentication mechanisms is another critical issue. Many low-cost RFID tags, in order to reduce complexity and cost, completely omit identity verification steps or use only simple static passwords. At the physical level, RFID tags typically lack sufficient tamper-resistant protection, allowing attackers to directly access tag memory contents through physical means, or even modify stored data. Tag cloning and counterfeiting is also a serious problem, as many RFID tags use fixed identifiers and lack encryption protection, making it relatively easy for attackers to copy tag information and create functionally identical counterfeit tags.

\subsection{Question 2: What types of sensitive information can hackers obtain through RFID attacks?}

\textbf{Answer:}

Through successful RFID attacks, hackers can obtain various types of sensitive information. In identity verification applications, attackers may obtain personal identity information, including names, employee numbers, student ID numbers, and other direct identity identifiers, as well as indirect identity information such as department affiliation and access privilege levels. In access control systems, hackers may steal access card information, security zone access permission data, and even timestamp information, which can be used to analyze user behavior patterns and activity routines. In commercial applications, RFID tags may contain product information, inventory data, supply chain information, and other commercially sensitive data. By obtaining this information, attackers can understand enterprise operational status, inventory levels, supplier relationships, and other business secrets.

\subsection{Question 3: How are RFID attacks executed?}

\textbf{Answer:}

RFID attacks can be implemented through various technical means. Eavesdropping attacks are the most basic attack method, where attackers use specialized radio frequency receiving equipment to intercept wirelessly transmitted data within the effective range of RFID tag and reader communication. Replay attacks exploit the weakness of RFID systems lacking temporal validation, where attackers first record legitimate RFID communication processes, then retransmit these recorded signals at a later time to deceive readers. Tag cloning is a more complex attack method, where attackers read all data from original tags, then write this data to new programmable tags, creating functionally identical replicas. Man-in-the-middle attacks involve attackers establishing malicious relay devices between tags and readers, intercepting, modifying, and forwarding communication data in real-time, thereby controlling the entire communication process.

\subsection{Question 4: What are the characteristics of RFID attacks?}

\textbf{Answer:}

RFID attacks possess a series of unique characteristics that give them a special position among cybersecurity threats. The attack's concealment is extremely strong; since RFID communication is wireless, attackers can implement attacks from considerable distances without being detected, and victims often have no idea that their RFID devices are being maliciously read or attacked. The convenience of attack implementation is also prominent; with the development of software-defined radio technology and the reduction in related equipment costs, both the technical threshold and economic cost required to implement RFID attacks have significantly decreased. The widespread nature of attack scope is equally noteworthy; a single successful attack may affect a large number of RFID devices, particularly in systems using the same technical standards or having the same vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Question 5: How can RFID security threats be mitigated?}

\textbf{Answer:}

Addressing RFID security threats requires adopting multi-layered, comprehensive protection strategies. At the technical level, implementing strong encryption is the most fundamental and important measure, using advanced encryption algorithms to protect communication between RFID tags and readers. Establishing mutual authentication mechanisms is equally critical; tags and readers should perform bidirectional identity verification before each communication, preventing unauthorized device access and counterfeit device deception. Dynamic data protection technology can effectively prevent replay attacks by using different session keys or timestamps in each communication, ensuring that even if attackers intercept communication content, they cannot implement attacks through replay. At the management level, establishing comprehensive RFID security management systems, including detailed RFID device deployment and usage specifications, regular security assessments and vulnerability scans, and necessary employee training. Physical security measures include physical protection of RFID tags and readers, preventing unauthorized physical access and tampering.

\section{High-Profile Cyber Attack Research}

\subsection{Question 1: What are some notable high-profile cyber attacks that have shaped modern cybersecurity understanding?}

\textbf{Answer:}

The cybersecurity landscape has been shaped by numerous high-profile attacks that have demonstrated the evolving sophistication of threat actors and the critical vulnerabilities in our digital infrastructure. Among the most significant incidents that have defined modern cybersecurity understanding are the Stuxnet virus attack, Marriott hotel data breach, United Nations data breach, Microsoft customer support database breach, and LifeLabs data breach. Each of these incidents represents different attack vectors, motivations, and consequences, providing valuable insights into the current threat environment and the challenges organizations face in protecting their digital assets.

\subsection{Question 2: Who were the primary victims of the Stuxnet attack?}

\textbf{Answer:}

The primary victims of the Stuxnet attack were Iran's nuclear facilities, with the Natanz uranium enrichment plant bearing the brunt of the damage. The malware specifically targeted Siemens SCADA systems and programmable logic controllers that controlled the centrifuges used in uranium enrichment. Beyond the immediate physical targets, the attack had broader implications for industrial control systems worldwide, as it demonstrated the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to sophisticated cyber attacks. The attack affected not only Iranian nuclear facilities but also raised awareness about the security of industrial control systems globally, leading to increased scrutiny and security measures across various industries.

\subsection{Question 3: What technical methods were employed in the Stuxnet attack?}

\textbf{Answer:}

The technical sophistication of Stuxnet was unprecedented, employing multiple zero-day exploits and advanced evasion techniques. The malware used four different zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows systems to propagate and establish persistence, demonstrating access to highly sophisticated exploit development capabilities. It employed stolen digital certificates to appear legitimate and avoid detection by security software. The malware was designed to remain dormant until it identified specific Siemens industrial control systems, at which point it would modify the control logic to cause centrifuges to spin at damaging speeds while reporting normal operations to monitoring systems. This level of technical sophistication suggested state-level resources and expertise.

\subsection{Question 4: What was the timeline of the Stuxnet attack?}

\textbf{Answer:}

The timeline of the Stuxnet attack reveals a carefully orchestrated, multi-year operation. Initial development likely began around 2005, with the first versions deployed around 2007. The malware underwent several iterations and updates over the years, suggesting ongoing development and refinement. The attack reached its peak effectiveness around 2009-2010, when it successfully damaged approximately 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz facility. The malware was first publicly identified in June 2010 by a Belarusian security company, though its full scope and purpose weren't understood until months later through detailed forensic analysis by security researchers.

\subsection{Question 5: What systems were specifically targeted by Stuxnet?}

\textbf{Answer:}

The target systems were specifically chosen for maximum impact on Iran's nuclear program. Stuxnet targeted Siemens Step 7 software and SCADA systems that controlled Siemens S7-300 and S7-400 programmable logic controllers. These systems were responsible for controlling the speed and operation of centrifuges used in uranium enrichment. The malware was designed to identify specific configurations of these systems, suggesting detailed intelligence about the target facilities' technical infrastructure. The precision of the targeting indicated extensive reconnaissance and intelligence gathering prior to the attack's deployment.

\subsection{Question 6: What were the motivations behind the Stuxnet attack?}

\textbf{Answer:}

The motivations behind the Stuxnet attack were primarily geopolitical, aimed at disrupting Iran's nuclear weapons development program without resorting to conventional military action. The attack represented a new form of warfare that could achieve strategic objectives through cyber means, potentially delaying Iran's nuclear program by several years. From a strategic perspective, the attack demonstrated the potential for cyber operations to serve as an alternative to kinetic military action, offering plausible deniability and reduced risk of escalation. The attack also served as a proof of concept for the potential of cyber weapons to cause physical damage to critical infrastructure.

\subsection{Question 7: What were the results and consequences of the Stuxnet attack?}

\textbf{Answer:}

The results and consequences of the Stuxnet attack were far-reaching and multifaceted. In terms of immediate physical impact, the attack successfully damaged approximately 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz facility, setting back Iran's nuclear enrichment program by an estimated 2-3 years. However, the broader implications were perhaps even more significant. The attack fundamentally changed the cybersecurity landscape by demonstrating that cyber attacks could cause physical damage to critical infrastructure. It led to increased awareness and investment in industrial control system security worldwide. The attack also established cyber operations as a legitimate tool of statecraft, leading to the development of cyber warfare capabilities by numerous nation-states. Additionally, the eventual discovery and analysis of Stuxnet provided valuable intelligence about advanced persistent threat techniques, contributing to improved defensive capabilities across the cybersecurity community.

\section{IoT Application Vulnerability Research and Analysis}

\subsection{What are the main IoT vulnerabilities in different vertical sectors?}

\textbf{Answer:}

IoT vulnerabilities vary significantly across different vertical sectors, each presenting unique security challenges and risks. In the industrial sector, IoT devices face numerous security challenges stemming from the convergence of operational technology with information technology networks. Manufacturing environments increasingly rely on connected sensors, automated control systems, and predictive maintenance tools that often lack adequate security measures. Primary vulnerabilities include weak authentication mechanisms, unencrypted communications, inadequate access controls, and insufficient security update mechanisms.

Energy systems represent another critical vertical where IoT vulnerabilities pose significant risks to national security and public safety. Smart grid technologies, renewable energy management systems, and distributed energy resources rely heavily on IoT devices for monitoring, control, and optimization. Common vulnerabilities include insecure communication protocols, weak device authentication, inadequate encryption of control commands, and insufficient monitoring of device behavior.

Healthcare represents one of the most vulnerable and high-stakes environments for IoT security, where device compromises can directly threaten patient safety and privacy. Medical IoT devices, including infusion pumps, pacemakers, insulin pumps, and patient monitoring systems, often contain critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited to harm patients or steal sensitive medical information.

Government sector IoT implementations face unique challenges related to national security, citizen privacy, and the protection of sensitive government operations. Smart city initiatives, border security systems, and government facility management increasingly rely on IoT technologies that present attractive targets for various threat actors.

\subsection{Who are the potential attackers targeting IoT systems and what are their motivations?}

\textbf{Answer:}

IoT systems attract various types of threat actors with different motivations across sectors. Nation-state actors seek to disrupt critical manufacturing capabilities, enemy infrastructure, healthcare systems, or gather intelligence on government operations. Their motivations include strategic advantage, espionage, and cyber warfare objectives.

Cybercriminals target IoT systems for financial gain through ransomware deployment, data theft for identity fraud, or extortion of utility companies and healthcare organizations. Industrial espionage groups attempt to steal proprietary manufacturing processes, trade secrets, and competitive intelligence.

Terrorist organizations aim to cause mass casualties by manipulating critical systems like medication delivery or energy infrastructure, seeking to create widespread fear and disruption. Environmental activists may target energy infrastructure to make political statements about environmental policies.

Insider threats include disgruntled employees or contractors with privileged access who may exploit their positions to harm specific targets or steal sensitive information. Hacktivist groups protest government policies by targeting government IoT systems and public services.

\subsection{What are the root causes of IoT vulnerabilities?}

\textbf{Answer:}

IoT vulnerabilities stem from multiple systemic and technical factors. The prioritization of operational efficiency over security considerations leads to inadequate security implementations. Legacy systems that were never designed with network connectivity in mind continue to operate without proper security measures.

Insufficient security expertise within operational technology teams results in poor security practices and inadequate risk assessment. The challenge of implementing security measures without disrupting critical production processes often leads to security being treated as a secondary concern.

Regulatory environments have historically focused on functionality and safety rather than cybersecurity, with agencies only recently beginning to address cybersecurity requirements. Manufacturers traditionally prioritize cost-effectiveness over security, viewing cybersecurity as an additional expense rather than a fundamental requirement.

The long operational lifespan of infrastructure means many systems in use today were designed decades ago without cybersecurity considerations. Complex procurement processes often fail to adequately address cybersecurity requirements, and budget constraints limit security investments.

\subsection{What specific vulnerabilities exist in medical infusion pumps?}

\textbf{Answer:}

Infusion pumps contain multiple categories of security weaknesses that pose significant risks to patient safety. Authentication vulnerabilities are prevalent, with many devices using default or weak passwords that are rarely changed, lacking multi-factor authentication capabilities, and having insufficient access controls that allow unauthorized users to modify device settings.

Communication security is often inadequate, with many pumps transmitting data over unencrypted channels, lacking secure communication protocols, and being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that could intercept or modify medication delivery commands.

Software vulnerabilities are common, including unpatched operating systems and applications, buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could allow code execution, and insufficient input validation that could be exploited through malformed data.

Physical security is frequently overlooked, with devices lacking tamper-evident seals or tamper-resistant hardware, having exposed ports that could be used for unauthorized access, and insufficient physical access controls in clinical environments.

\subsection{How can IoT vulnerabilities be mitigated across different sectors?}

\textbf{Answer:}

Mitigating IoT vulnerabilities requires comprehensive approaches tailored to each sector's specific needs. Technical measures include implementing strong authentication and access controls, encrypting all communications between devices and networks, regularly updating device firmware and software, conducting regular security assessments and penetration testing, implementing network segmentation to isolate IoT devices, and deploying monitoring systems to detect anomalous device behavior.

Administrative measures involve establishing comprehensive IoT security policies and procedures, including device procurement security standards, deployment security requirements, operational security protocols, and incident response procedures. Staff training is crucial, requiring enhanced cybersecurity awareness for workers, IT administrators, and device maintenance personnel.

Industry-level measures include establishing unified IoT device security standards and certification systems, providing clear security requirements and implementation guidance for manufacturers. Regulatory reform is necessary, requiring improvements to security certification processes while balancing security and innovation.

For specific sectors, industrial environments require network segmentation to isolate IoT devices from corporate networks and development of incident response plans specifically tailored to industrial operations. Energy systems need defense-in-depth strategies with multiple layers of security controls and enhanced coordination between energy companies and government cybersecurity agencies. Healthcare requires vendor management systems with strict security assessment processes and emergency response plans designed for medical cybersecurity incidents. Government implementations need rigorous security requirements in procurement processes and comprehensive incident response plans that coordinate with law enforcement and national security agencies.

\section{Core Cybersecurity Concepts Q\&A}

\subsection{What are the typical stages of complex system or network attacks?}

\textbf{Answer:}

Complex cyber attacks typically follow a systematic attack lifecycle that can be divided into seven interconnected stages. The attack begins with the reconnaissance stage, where attackers collect target information through passive and active means, including gathering organizational information, employee profiles, and technical architecture through open sources, as well as probing target systems' specific configurations and potential weaknesses through technical means such as port scanning and network mapping.

After obtaining sufficient information, attackers enter the weaponization stage, creating or acquiring malicious software payloads, combining malicious code with seemingly harmless files, and preparing various attack tools and backdoor programs.

The delivery stage is the critical phase where attackers transmit malicious payloads to targets, commonly through phishing emails, malicious websites, USB device drops, social engineering techniques to induce targets to execute malicious code, or through more complex methods like supply chain attacks to plant malicious code.

Once the malicious payload successfully reaches the target system, attackers enter the exploitation stage, gaining initial access through system vulnerabilities, software flaws, or configuration errors, executing malicious code and establishing a foothold in the target system while working to bypass various security defenses.

After gaining initial access, attackers proceed to the installation stage, deploying persistent backdoors on target systems, establishing communication channels with command and control servers, and ensuring continued access even if systems are rebooted or undergo security cleanup.

The subsequent command and control stage establishes stable communication between attackers and compromised systems, allowing attackers to remotely send commands and receive execution results while periodically collecting system status information and sensitive data.

The final actions stage is when attackers achieve their ultimate objectives, which may include large-scale data theft, system destruction, lateral movement to other systems, ransomware deployment, or conducting long-term covert monitoring and intelligence gathering.

\subsection{What are the most common vulnerabilities facing organizations?}

\textbf{Answer:}

Modern organizations face security vulnerabilities that are diverse and complex, analyzable from multiple dimensions including technical, network, application, human factors, and physical security.

Technical vulnerabilities are the most fundamental and common security threats, with unpatched software vulnerabilities occupying a significant proportion, including known security flaws in operating systems, applications, and firmware that often persist due to poor patch management practices. Weak passwords and default credentials are equally prevalent, with many systems still using easily guessable passwords or default usernames and passwords that have never been changed, providing convenient entry points for attackers. Configuration errors are another important source of technical vulnerabilities, where insecure configurations of servers, databases, firewalls, and other critical systems may expose sensitive data or provide unauthorized access paths.

Network-level vulnerabilities primarily manifest in security flaws in communication protocols and network architecture. Many organizations still use insecure plaintext transmission protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet, making sensitive data vulnerable to interception during transmission. Insufficient network segmentation is a widespread problem, where lack of appropriate network isolation and access controls allows attackers to move freely within internal networks once they breach perimeter defenses. Wireless network security is equally concerning, with weakly encrypted or completely open Wi-Fi networks providing convenient channels for attackers to enter organizational networks.

Application vulnerabilities are particularly prominent in web applications and enterprise software. Injection attacks (including SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting attacks, etc.) remain the most common application security threats, exploiting insufficient input validation in applications. Authentication and session management flaws enable attackers to potentially bypass authentication mechanisms or hijack user sessions, while access control deficiencies may lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

Human factors are often the weakest link in the security defense chain. Employee insensitivity to social engineering attacks makes them easy victims of phishing emails, phone scams, and other attacks. Insider threats are equally important, whether from malicious insiders or security incidents caused by negligence, both can cause serious losses to organizations. Overall insufficient security awareness, including lack of regular cybersecurity training and updated security knowledge, leaves employees lacking response capabilities when facing new threats.

Physical security vulnerabilities, though often overlooked, are equally important, including insufficient physical access controls for server rooms and workstations, as well as risks of laptops, mobile devices, and other equipment containing sensitive information being lost or stolen.

\subsection{How do authentication and access control differ?}

\textbf{Answer:}

Authentication and access control are two closely related but functionally different core concepts in information security systems that play complementary roles in security protection.

Authentication primarily addresses the question "who are you," being the process of verifying the authenticity of a user's or entity's claimed identity. This process typically occurs at the initial stage when users attempt to access systems or resources, confirming the legitimacy of their identity by verifying user-provided credentials. Authentication can be based on information users know (such as passwords, PIN codes, security question answers), items users possess (such as smart cards, tokens, phones), users' biometric characteristics (such as fingerprints, iris, facial features), or combinations of these factors (multi-factor authentication). Authentication is typically a one-time process; once users successfully pass authentication, a session is established that doesn't require repeated authentication during the session's validity period.

Access control, on the other hand, addresses the question "what can you do," being the process of determining and enforcing what resources authenticated users can access and what operations they can perform. Access control occurs after successful authentication and continues throughout the user's session, making decisions about whether to allow or deny specific access requests based on predefined policies and rules. Access control mechanisms include discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC), and role-based access control (RBAC), each providing different levels of granularity and control over resource access.

\subsection{What does non-repudiation mean in cybersecurity?}

\textbf{Answer:}

Non-repudiation is a fundamental security principle that ensures parties cannot deny their involvement in a transaction or communication after it has occurred. In cybersecurity contexts, non-repudiation provides proof of the origin, delivery, and integrity of data, preventing individuals from falsely denying that they sent, received, or accessed specific information.

Non-repudiation is typically achieved through digital signatures, timestamps, and audit logs that create an irrefutable record of actions and communications. Digital signatures use cryptographic techniques to bind a message to its sender, making it mathematically infeasible for the sender to later deny having created the signature. Timestamps provide chronological proof of when actions occurred, while comprehensive audit logs maintain detailed records of system activities and user actions.

This principle is particularly important in legal, financial, and business contexts where accountability and proof of actions are crucial. For example, in electronic commerce, non-repudiation ensures that buyers cannot deny placing orders and sellers cannot deny receiving payments. In legal proceedings, non-repudiation provides evidence that can be used to establish facts about digital communications and transactions.

\subsection{What is social engineering and what are three examples of social engineering attacks?}

\textbf{Answer:}

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human psychology and behavior to gain unauthorized access to systems, information, or physical locations. Rather than relying on technical vulnerabilities, social engineering attacks target the human element of security, which is often considered the weakest link in any security system.

Three common examples of social engineering attacks include:

**Phishing Attacks:** These involve sending deceptive emails, text messages, or other communications that appear to come from legitimate sources such as banks, government agencies, or trusted companies. The messages typically contain urgent requests for sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identification details, or include malicious links that lead to fake websites designed to steal credentials.

**Pretexting:** This technique involves creating a fabricated scenario or identity to engage with victims and extract information. Attackers might impersonate IT support personnel, bank representatives, or other trusted figures to convince targets to reveal sensitive information or perform actions that compromise security. The attacker typically researches the target beforehand to make their pretext more convincing.

**Baiting:** This attack involves offering something enticing to spark curiosity and prompt victims to take actions that compromise security. Common examples include leaving infected USB drives in public places where targets are likely to find them, or offering free downloads of popular software that actually contains malware. The "bait" exploits human curiosity and the desire for free or valuable items.

\subsection{What is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack and how does it work?}

\textbf{Answer:}

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic from multiple sources. Unlike simple denial of service attacks that originate from a single source, DDoS attacks use multiple compromised computer systems to generate the attack traffic, making them more difficult to defend against and trace back to their origin.

The DDoS attack process typically follows several stages. First, attackers build a botnet by infecting numerous computers, IoT devices, or servers with malware, creating a network of compromised systems called "zombies" or "bots" that can be remotely controlled. The attacker then selects and reconnaissance the target, identifying potential vulnerabilities and determining the most effective attack vectors.

During the attack execution phase, the attacker sends commands to the botnet, instructing all compromised systems to simultaneously send traffic to the target. This coordinated assault can take various forms, including volumetric attacks that consume bandwidth, protocol attacks that exploit weaknesses in network protocols, and application layer attacks that target specific services or applications.

The massive volume of traffic from hundreds, thousands, or even millions of sources overwhelms the target's resources, including bandwidth, processing power, or memory, causing legitimate users to be unable to access the service. The distributed nature of the attack makes it extremely difficult to block, as traffic appears to come from many legitimate sources across the internet.

DDoS attacks can cause significant disruption, financial losses, and reputational damage to organizations. Defense strategies include implementing traffic filtering, rate limiting, content delivery networks (CDNs), and specialized DDoS protection services that can detect and mitigate attack traffic while allowing legitimate users to maintain access to services.

Access control addresses the question "what can you do," being the process of determining which resources users can access and which operations they can perform after successful authentication. Access control is a continuous process that operates throughout the entire user session, checking whether users have appropriate permissions each time they attempt to access specific resources or perform specific operations. Access control can be implemented using different models, including Discretionary Access Control (DAC), where resource owners decide who can access their resources; Mandatory Access Control (MAC), where systems enforce access control according to predefined security policies; Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which assigns permissions based on users' roles within organizations; and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which dynamically determines access permissions based on various attributes of users, resources, and environments.

There are clear temporal relationships and functional distinctions between the two. Authentication must occur before access control because only after confirming user identity can systems know which access control policies to apply. From a functional purpose perspective, authentication focuses on verifying identity authenticity, while access control focuses on managing and enforcing permission policies. From a scope perspective, authentication is typically a one-time verification process, while access control is a continuous process throughout the session. In practical applications, these two mechanisms must work together to provide complete security protection; lacking either would result in security vulnerabilities.

\subsection{The Meaning of Non-Repudiation}

Non-repudiation is an important concept in information security that ensures participants in communications or transactions cannot deny actions they have performed or information they have sent, providing technical guarantees for trust and accountability in the digital world. This concept includes two main aspects: sender non-repudiation, ensuring message senders cannot deny they sent specific messages; and receiver non-repudiation, ensuring message receivers cannot deny they received specific messages. In broader application scenarios, non-repudiation also involves behavioral non-repudiation, where users cannot deny they performed specific operations or participated in specific transactions.

The implementation of non-repudiation relies on comprehensive application of multiple technical mechanisms. Digital signatures are the core technology, using senders' private keys to sign messages, simultaneously providing identity authentication, data integrity protection, and non-repudiation guarantees, because only private key holders can generate valid digital signatures, while anyone can use corresponding public keys to verify signature validity. Timestamp services provide trusted time proof for transactions or communications, ensuring parties cannot dispute the timing of events. Detailed audit logs record user behaviors and system events, providing evidence support for subsequent accountability tracing. Digital certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) provide identity verification and key management support for the entire non-repudiation system.

Non-repudiation has widespread application value in modern digital society. In e-commerce, it ensures the legal validity of online transactions, preventing buyers and sellers from denying their participation or commitments after transaction completion. In email communications, digital signatures can prevent senders from denying they sent specific emails, which is particularly important in business communications and legal document transmission. Digital contract signing relies on non-repudiation to ensure contract legal validity, giving electronic signatures the same legal status as traditional handwritten signatures. In financial transactions, non-repudiation prevents transaction parties from denying specific financial operations, providing security guarantees for electronic banking and mobile payments. From a legal perspective, non-repudiation provides technical foundations for electronic evidence validity, making digital transactions and communications acceptable as evidence in courts, which is crucial for healthy development of the digital economy.

\subsection{The Meaning of Social Engineering Attacks and Three Examples}

Social engineering attacks are a unique type of cybersecurity threat that does not rely on technical vulnerabilities or system flaws, but rather exploits human psychological weaknesses and social behavioral patterns to achieve attack objectives. This attack method uses deception, manipulation, or inducement to make target personnel voluntarily provide sensitive information, grant access permissions, or perform specific behaviors beneficial to attackers. The core of social engineering attacks lies in psychological manipulation, where attackers understand human psychological characteristics such as trust, fear, curiosity, authority worship, and helping tendencies, and skillfully exploit these characteristics to construct attack scenarios. Attackers typically impersonate authority figures, colleagues, friends, or service providers, leveraging people's natural trust in these roles to lower targets' vigilance. To increase attack credibility, attackers often collect large amounts of public information beforehand, including organizational structures, employee information, and business processes, to construct realistic attack situations.

Phishing email attacks are one of the most common and successful forms of social engineering attacks. In these attacks, attackers carefully craft seemingly legitimate emails from banks, social media platforms, e-commerce websites, or victims' workplaces. These emails typically claim user accounts have security issues, require identity verification, or have important notifications to review, creating urgency and necessity. Links in emails direct users to carefully forged login pages that are nearly indistinguishable from real websites in appearance. When users enter usernames and passwords on these fake pages, attackers can obtain these valuable account credentials. The success of these attacks largely depends on precise psychological manipulation, including trust in authoritative institutions, concern for account security, and the human tendency to overlook security details in emergency situations.

Phone scams (also called voice phishing) represent the application of social engineering attacks in voice communications. In typical phone scam scenarios, attackers impersonate IT support personnel, bank customer service, or other technical service providers, proactively calling target users. Attackers typically claim to have detected suspicious account activity, system technical failures, or need to conduct routine security checks, creating reasonable contact reasons and urgent processing needs. During calls, attackers request users to provide passwords, personal identification information, or request remote access to users' computers to "solve problems." To increase credibility, attackers often use professional technical terminology, demonstrate knowledge about users or organizations, and may have already obtained some basic information to prove their "identity." This attack is particularly effective because voice communication gives a more direct and trustworthy feeling, and users often relax their vigilance during phone conversations.

Physical penetration is the direct manifestation of social engineering attacks in the real world, where attackers gain physical access or sensitive information through face-to-face interactions. In these attacks, attackers typically prepare identity disguises carefully, wearing uniforms of maintenance workers, delivery personnel, cleaning staff, or other service personnel, carrying corresponding tools or props to increase credibility. Attackers may claim they need to inspect network equipment, deliver important documents, perform routine maintenance, or handle emergency technical issues. This attack skillfully exploits people's politeness and helping psychology; most employees are reluctant to question seemingly official service personnel, especially when they demonstrate professional knowledge and urgent needs. Once physical access is gained, attackers may install malicious devices (such as keyloggers, network eavesdropping devices) without supervision, photograph sensitive documents, or directly steal information from computer systems. The success of these attacks often depends on attackers' acting skills and deep understanding of target environments.

\subsection{The Meaning and Attack Process of Distributed Denial of Service Attacks}

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are complex network attack methods where attackers coordinate and control large numbers of computer systems distributed globally to simultaneously send massive malicious requests to target servers, websites, or network services. The purpose is to consume target systems' computational resources, network bandwidth, or service capacity, making them unable to respond normally to legitimate user requests, thereby causing service interruption or complete unavailability. Compared to traditional single-point denial of service attacks, the distributed nature of DDoS attacks gives them greater destructive power and stronger concealment, while also making defense more difficult.

DDoS attack implementation is a carefully planned multi-stage process. The first stage of attack is establishing botnets, where attackers spread malware through various methods, including sending phishing emails, establishing malicious websites, and exploiting software vulnerabilities for automated infection. This malware infects large numbers of personal computers, servers, routers, cameras, smart home appliances, and various other networked devices, converting them into "zombie machines." Attackers subsequently establish command and control server networks, with infected devices regularly communicating with these servers, awaiting attack instructions. Modern botnets may include tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of controlled devices distributed across countries and regions worldwide.

In the attack preparation stage, attackers carefully select and analyze attack targets, which may be specific websites, online services, enterprise networks, or critical infrastructure. Attackers conduct detailed reconnaissance of targets, understanding their network architecture, server configurations, bandwidth capacity, and existing security protection measures to determine the most effective attack strategies and methods. This process may include port scanning, service identification, load testing, and other technical means, aimed at finding target system performance bottlenecks and weak points.

When everything is ready, attackers issue attack commands to the entire botnet through command and control servers, specifying attack targets, attack types, attack intensity, and duration. Thousands to tens of thousands of zombie machines begin sending malicious traffic to targets at nearly the same time, forming a coordinated attack action. Attackers may employ multiple different attack types to maximize attack effectiveness.

Volumetric attacks focus on consuming target network bandwidth by sending large amounts of data packets to clog network connections. UDP flood attacks send large numbers of UDP packets to random ports on targets, forcing target systems to process these useless requests. ICMP floods consume bandwidth and processing resources by sending large numbers of ping requests. Amplification attacks are particularly cunning techniques where attackers exploit characteristics of network services like DNS, NTP, and SNMP, sending small request packets that trigger targets to return much larger response packets, thereby producing greater attack effects with smaller attack traffic.

Protocol attacks target weaknesses in network protocol stacks, attempting to exhaust target systems' connection resources. SYN flood attacks send large numbers of TCP connection requests but never complete the three-way handshake process, causing target servers' connection tables to fill up and become unable to process new legitimate connection requests. Ping of Death attacks send ICMP packets exceeding normal size limits, potentially causing target systems to crash or become unstable.

Application layer attacks are the most complex and difficult to defend against DDoS attack types because they simulate normal user behavior, making it extremely difficult to distinguish malicious traffic from legitimate traffic. HTTP flood attacks send large numbers of seemingly normal HTTP requests, but these requests may target resource-intensive pages or functions, quickly exhausting server processing capabilities. Slowloris attacks exhaust server connection pools by establishing large numbers of slow HTTP connections, with each connection remaining active but transmitting extremely slowly, ultimately preventing servers from accepting new connections.

The impacts of DDoS attacks are multifaceted and far-reaching. Direct technical impacts include complete target service interruption, users unable to access websites or use online services, network response speeds becoming extremely slow or completely timing out.
