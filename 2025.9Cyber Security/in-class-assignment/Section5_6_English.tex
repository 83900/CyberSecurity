\section{Typical Attack Case Studies}

\subsection{WannaCry Ransomware Attack (2017)}

\subsubsection{Attack Overview}
WannaCry was a global ransomware attack that broke out in May 2017, exploiting the EternalBlue vulnerability (CVE-2017-0144) leaked by the NSA to spread rapidly worldwide, affecting over 300,000 computers in more than 150 countries.

\subsubsection{Technical Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Propagation Method}: Worm-like spread using Windows SMB protocol vulnerabilities
    \item \textbf{Encryption Algorithm}: AES-128 for file encryption, RSA-2048 for AES key encryption
    \item \textbf{Ransom Demand}: Initial ransom of \$300, increasing to \$600 after three days
    \item \textbf{Payment Method}: Required Bitcoin payment for ransom
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Impact Scope}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Healthcare Systems}: UK's National Health Service (NHS) severely affected, multiple hospitals forced to cancel surgeries and outpatient services
    \item \textbf{Transportation}: German railway system displays infected, Russian railway services partially disrupted
    \item \textbf{Manufacturing}: Renault car factories shut down, Nissan UK plant suspended production
    \item \textbf{Government Agencies}: Multiple government departments and public service institutions affected across countries
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Economic Losses}
The WannaCry attack is estimated to have caused global economic losses exceeding \$4 billion, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct business interruption losses
    \item System recovery and reconstruction costs
    \item Data recovery expenses
    \item Reputation damage and customer loss
\end{itemize}

\subsection{NotPetya Attack (2017)}

\subsubsection{Attack Overview}
NotPetya (also known as ExPetr or Petya) was another major ransomware attack that broke out in June 2017, primarily targeting Ukraine but quickly spreading to multiple countries worldwide.

\subsubsection{Attack Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial Infection}: Supply chain attack through Ukrainian accounting software MEDoc's update mechanism
    \item \textbf{Propagation Mechanism}: Combined EternalBlue vulnerability and credential theft techniques for lateral movement
    \item \textbf{Destructiveness}: Not only encrypted files but also destroyed Master Boot Record (MBR)
    \item \textbf{True Purpose}: Subsequent analysis suggested this was more of a destructive attack rather than pure ransomware
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Major Impact Cases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maersk Group}: World's largest container shipping company, complete IT system paralysis, losses exceeding \$300 million
    \item \textbf{FedEx}: TNT Express subsidiary severely affected, Q1 losses of \$400 million

    \item \textbf{Ukrainian Infrastructure}: Banks, power companies, airports, and other critical infrastructure affected
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Colonial Pipeline Attack (2021)}

\subsubsection{Attack Overview}
In May 2021, Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline operator in the United States, suffered a DarkSide ransomware attack, leading to a 6-day shutdown of the entire pipeline system and causing fuel shortages on the US East Coast.

\subsubsection{Attack Process}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial Access}: Network access gained through leaked VPN credentials
    \item \textbf{Data Theft}: Attackers stole approximately 100GB of sensitive data
    \item \textbf{System Encryption}: Encrypted critical IT systems, forcing the company to proactively shut down pipeline operations
    \item \textbf{Ransom Demand}: Demanded approximately \$5 million in Bitcoin ransom
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Social Impact}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fuel Shortages}: Gasoline shortages and panic buying in the southeastern United States
    \item \textbf{Price Increases}: Significant gasoline price increases
    \item \textbf{Transportation Impact}: Airlines forced to adjust flight schedules
    \item \textbf{National Security}: Exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Kaseya Supply Chain Attack (2021)}

\subsubsection{Attack Overview}
In July 2021, the REvil ransomware group attacked managed service provider Kaseya's VSA software, indirectly infecting approximately 1,500 downstream customer companies.

\subsubsection{Attack Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supply Chain Attack}: Exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Kaseya VSA software
    \item \textbf{Mass Distribution}: Affected thousands of enterprises through a single attack point
