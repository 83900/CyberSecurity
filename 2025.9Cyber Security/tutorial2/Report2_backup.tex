\textbf{Answer:}

MITRE ATT\&CK is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.  The ATT\&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. 

The framework catalogs cybercriminal tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) through each phase of the cyberattack lifecycle—from an attacker's initial information gathering and planning behaviors, through to the ultimate execution of the attack. 

\subsubsection{How is the MITRE ATT\\subsubsection{How is the MITRE ATT\\subsubsection{How is the MITRE ATT\\subsection{How is the MITRE ATT\&CK Framework organized?}CK Framework organized?}CK Framework organized?}CK Framework organized?}

\textbf{Answer:}

The MITRE ATT\&CK framework is organized into matrices that outline different stages of an adversary's attack lifecycle, known as tactics, and the specific methods they use, known as techniques. 

MITRE ATT\&CK organizes adversary tactics and techniques (and subtechniques) into matrices. Each matrix includes tactics and techniques corresponding to attacks on specific domains: 

- \textbf{Enterprise Matrix} - Focuses on techniques affecting enterprise networks and systems
- \textbf{Mobile Matrix} - Covers techniques targeting mobile devices and platforms
- \textbf{Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Matrix} - Focuses on techniques affecting industrial systems in critical infrastructure sectors

Each column in a matrix represents a tactic (the adversary's technical goals), and to achieve these tactics, adversaries use different methods called techniques.

WEP is considered fundamentally flawed and provides inadequate security for wireless LANs due to multiple critical vulnerabilities:

\textbf{1. Cryptographic Weaknesses}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RC4 Key Scheduling Flaws:} The RC4 algorithm implementation in WEP has inherent weaknesses in key scheduling
    \item \textbf{Weak Key Generation:} Certain key combinations produce predictable keystreams
    \item \textbf{Statistical Biases:} RC4 output exhibits statistical patterns that can be exploited
    \item \textbf{Impact:} Enables cryptanalytic attacks to recover encryption keys
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Initialization Vector (IV) Problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Short IV Length:} Only 24 bits, leading to frequent repetition (birthday paradox)
    \item \textbf{IV Reuse:} Same IV + same key = same keystream, enabling plaintext recovery
    \item \textbf{Weak IVs:} Certain IV values make key recovery trivial
    \item \textbf{Predictable IV Sequences:} Many implementations use sequential or predictable IVs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Authentication Weaknesses}

    \item \textbf{End-to-End Security:} Provides security between the original source and destination
    \item \textbf{Minimal Overhead:} Lower bandwidth overhead compared to tunnel mode
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technical Implementation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AH Transport:} AH header inserted between IP header and payload
    \item \textbf{ESP Transport:} ESP header/trailer encapsulates only the payload
    \item \textbf{IP Header Visibility:} Routing information remains visible to intermediate devices
    \item \textbf{Direct Communication:} No additional IP encapsulation required
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Suitable Scenarios for Transport Mode:}
